<h2>Grief Work <small>Natalie Diaz</small></h2>
<p>I have gazed the black flower blooming
her animal eye. Gacela oscura. Negra llorona.</p>
<p>Along the clayen banks I follow her-astonished,
gathering grief’s petals she lets fall like horns.</p>
<p>Why not now go toward the things I love?</p>
<p>Like Jacob’s angel, I touched the garnet of her wrist,
and she knew my name. And I knew hers—
it was Auxocromo, it was Cromóforo, it was Eliza.
It hurtled through me like honeyed-rum.</p>
<p>When the eyes and lips are touched with honey
what is seen and said will never be the same.</p>
<p>Eve took the apple in that ache-opened mouth,
on fire and in pieces, from the knife’s sharp edge.</p>
<p>In the photo her fist presses against the red-gold
geometry of her thigh. Black nylon, black garter,
unsolvable mysterium—I have to close my eyes to see.</p>
<p>Achilles chasing Hektor round the walls of Ilium
three times. How long must I circle
the high gate above her knees?</p>
<p>Again the gods put their large hands in me,
move me, break my heart like a clay jar of wine,
loosen a beast from some darklong depth—</p>
<p>my melancholy is hoofed. I, the terrible beautiful
Lampon, a shining devour-horse tethered
at the bronze manger of her collarbones.</p>
